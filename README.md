# Leukemia Detection using Image Processing

Leukemia is a blood cancer caused by a rise in the number of white blood cells in the body. These affected white blood cells capture the bone marrow and stays in it and reproducing in an uncontrolled way.With the help of this method, we are able to detect whether the person is having normal cells or leukemic(abnormal) cells.
